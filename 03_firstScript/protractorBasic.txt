01. Protractor Setup
    Pre-requisite= Install Node and VS Code
    01. Install = npm install -g protractor
    02. Install drivers = webdriver-manager update
    03. Start Selenium Server = webdriver-manager start

02. Test Structure
    01. 'spec' file = Test case file. It is same as class file in Java.
    02. 'describe' block = It is the test suite inside each spec file.
    03. 'it' block = It is test case block inside each 'describe' block.

    Project Folder
        |_spec.js (Test case file)
            |_describe (Test suite)
                |_it (Test case)
        |_conf.js

03. Configuration file
    01. The configuration tells Protractor where your test files (specs) are, and where to talk to your Selenium Server (seleniumAddress). 
    02. It will use the defaults for all other configuration. Chrome is the default browser.
    03. conf.js contents
        exports.config = {
            framework: 'jasmine',   //We will use jasmine test framework with Protractor. It is same as TestNG, Junit in Java.
            seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',    //Location of where to listen too Selenium server.
            //directConnect: true,   //Instead of starting server first and then using it, we can use directConnect to open Chrome browser before each test execution.
            specs: ['todo-spec.js']     //Details if spec file to execute should be specified in this array.
        };

04. Run Test
    01. Traverse to project folder where script/spec files are located.
    02. Hit command 'protractor conf.js'.
